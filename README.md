<h1>The Score Keeper üèÜ </h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This is a website that tests users on 20 different celebrities. The users at each question must recognize the randomized celebrity presented in an image on the screen, and select the correct name that matches. If the user makes the wrong selection, they are informed that it is incorrect and allowed to try again. If the user selects the correct name, the user is informed that it is correct and a point is added to the total amount answered correctly. Either way, after the user makes a selection, the user is able to click onto the next question. The user is able to keep getting tested on the 20 celebrities as many times as they would like until they feel though they are completely familar with every celebrity on the quiz.
